# Hacked-Info.plist-for-Windows-10-Unsupported-BootCamp
Here is a hacked info.plist for BootCamp for Windows 10 on unsupported Macs. 
Add your Boot ROM under DArequiredROMS at the top.
This works for 2010-2011 MacBook Pros, Late 2008 Al MacBooks.
If your Mac is not listed, let me know so I can add more.
Replace your info.plist in bootcamp with the hacked info.plist created by me.
Windows 7 is not an option in bootcamp anymore.
Should work fr any Unibody Alimunum Mac.
